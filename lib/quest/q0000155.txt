Q:155:T:Advisor->The King is in terrible danger, Morgoth has
Q:155:T:sent an assassin to kill him. 
Q:155:T:King->Morgoth is unhappy about our Dwarven allience, and
Q:155:T:has managed to bribe a Dwarf named Nar to do this dirty
Q:155:T:deed. The irony of using a Dwarf to assassinate me is
Q:155:T:just the kind of vile cunning that I should have expected
Q:155:T:from Morgoth. The Dwarven Leader has sent his own men to
