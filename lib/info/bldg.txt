=== Historical Town View ===

The town is composed of both stores and buildings. Stores sell products
while buildings provide services.  Prices for products and services may
vary depending on your charisma, race and class.  Some buildings only
offer certain services to members of the appropriate guilds and other
services at steep premiums to non-members. You membership is based upon
your class.
