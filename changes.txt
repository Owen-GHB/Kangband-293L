Kangband 2.9.3r1
================

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed bug preventing the wiz_create_item debug command from being
  able to create Druid and Illusionist books.
- Fixed problem with the names of two of the new amulets.
- Fixed problems with Druid and Illusionists being assigned the wrong
  list of spells.
- Fixed problem with Bloodspike not being correctly generated in one
  of the new quests.

- The "disintegrate" spell will no longer affect permanent grids.


Kangband 2.9.3
==============

Codebase Updates
----------------
- Updated Kangband to the Angband 2.9.3 code base and applied latest
  bug fixes where applicable.
- Moved some Kangband-specific code to different, more appropriate
  locations.

New / Changed Features
----------------------
- Added the quests for the four empty plots included in 2.9.2r2.
  These need additional play testing.  This addition should allow
  players to properly import characters started in KangbandTk.
- Updated the help files for the new races, classes, terrain and
  added some other corrections.  The help files still need more work.
- Removed the [y/n/k] pickup prompt.  Players should use the command
  command to access the auto-destroy/auto-pickup menus available from
  the main options screen to get this functionality for individual
  object types.
- Added some color to quest-related messages so that they are more
  visible to the player.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug with the Sauron and Morgoth quests which made it
  impossible to win the game.
- Fixed a bug preventing unique's escorts from being generated inside
  quest levels under certain circumstances.
- Fixed bug with the town lighting code keeping certain terrain types
  illuminated at night.
- Fixed a bug with being able to run across chasm terrain under
  certain circumstances.
- Fixed a bug with the "Compare weapons" service .. this still needs
  more work.


Kangband 2.9.2r2
================

New / Changed Features
----------------------
- Permanently turned on the functionality of the following options
  (which have been removed): "flow_by_sound", "flow_by_smell",
  "smart_monsters", "smart_packs", "smart_learn". Also, "smart_cheat"
  is now a birth option.
- Added a "fast_flow" option that makes the monster flow code less
  CPU intensive (from Zangband/Oangband). 
- Added two new flags "GOOD" and "FRIENDLY". Monsters assigned the
  'FRIENDLY' flag will fight for the player unless he betrays them.
  (l)ooking at a monster will tell you whether it is friendly or not.
- "Friendly" monsters will occasionally be given "pet" status. Pets
  have a chance of remaining "friendly" if the player damages them.
- Added commands to control friendly monsters (accessed via '$') and
  made friendly monsters smarter (adapted from Zangband).
- Added HURT_LITE, HURT_ACID, HURT_ELEC, HURT_FIRE and HURT_COLD to the
  list of available flags for items and players.  HURT_LITE prevents
  any resistance to light attacks. The others flags prevent temporary
  resistance to their respective attack forms. They do not affect the
  permanent resistances.
- Also added the "GHOSTLY" and "INVISIBLE" flags for items and players.
  These flags make the player "ghostlike" and invisible respectively.
- Added two new races - Ents and Wraiths. Ents are taken pretty much
  from Oangband without the hard-coded changes to STR, DEX, etc. Ents
  have the HURT_FIRE flag.  Wraiths may pass through walls and resist
  cold and poison intrinsically. However, they aggravate and are hurt
  by light.
- The One Ring now has both the GHOSTLY and INVISIBLE flags as do
  Amulets of Doom.
- You can no longer regenerate mana or hitpoints when passing through
  walls.
- Added the "ARCHER", "BERSERKER" and "COWARDLY" flags for monsters.
  These flags affect how the monster will move towards/from the player.
  Archers and cowards attempt to keep some distance between them and
  the player.  Berserkers will never run away.
- Reworked the way AQUATIC monsters are placed. The game will now try
  very hard to place them if a water streamer is generated.
- Clairvoyance and Magic Mapping, will now correctly display terrain
  streamers.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Patches for the latest bug fixes for Angband 2.9.2 applied where
  aplicable.
- Fixed a bug with the "smart_learn" ability of monsters.
- Fixed a bug with the saving of the cave_special array.
- Fixed a bug with the [y/n/k] prompt not flushing messages properly.
- Fixed various other quest-related bugs and oddities.


Kangband 2.9.2r1
================

Codebase Updates
----------------
- Quest designers may now specify the generation of a random artifact,
  a specific ego item, a specific item with an appropriate random ego
  type or a totally random ego item.
- Removed support for loading savefiles from versions of Kangband older
  than 2.8.3(x).
- Various tweaks/additions to the pref files.
  

New / Changed Features
----------------------
- Selectively implemented Jonathan Ellis' updates to the *_info.txt
  files for objects and artifacts.
- Added an auto-destoy item and auto-pick-up item feature (accessed via
  the '#' command) which makes the game automatically destroy or
  pick-up an item as the player moves over it. This is not the
  "squelch" patch although some code was adapted from that in refining
  the original implementation.
- Added the [y/n/k] pick-up prompt from Zangband.
- Added the "Time of day" command from Zangband ('[' in the roguelike
  key set).
- Studying spells is now done via the 'G' command rather than in the
  buildings.
- Items created via the debugging mode commands 'g' and 'v' will now
  be created unid'd. Use cheat_iden if you want this functionality.
- Mages and Illusionists now require progressively less energy to use
  wands and rods. Priests and Druids require progressively less energy
  to use staves.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Patches for the latest bug fixes for Angband 2.9.2 applied where
  aplicable.
- You no longer receive inappropriate 'feeling' messages in the Arena
  or in fixed quests.
- Specified ego items (where sensible) are now generated in the fixed
  quests.
- Various problems with the towns/quests fixed.


Kangband 2.9.2
==============

Codebase Updates
----------------
- Upgraded the source code base to Angband 2.9.2. (See the change logs
  for standard Angband for details).
- Changed some minor feature differences so as to conform Kangband
  more closely with standard Angband (mostly combat stuff).
- Conformed vault generation with standard Angband. The customized
  vaults will be added back in the next version via a different
  methodology.
- Updated building and quest-handling code to that of Zangband 2.4.0.
  This necessitated some changes to quests and buildings. Note that
  characters loaded from earlier versions will have their arena and
  quest information reset as a result of this change.

New / Changed Features
----------------------
- Entering and leaving quests is now done via the '<' and '>' commands.
- Added a Maia race similar to that of Oangband (from where the stats
  and histories were taken). Maia have intrinsic regeneration and
  slowed digestion. Unlike Oangband, their score is not adjusted.
- The temporary high resistances available to certain classes are now
  cummulative with the permanent high resistances and offer the same
  protection from magical attack side effects (such as stunning and
  confusion).
- The Monster AI options now factor in the temporary resistances when
  choosing which spell a monster will cast.
- Made some changes to allow 'magical items' to be artifacts and added
  four new artifact rods.  The name 'Rod of Delving' was taken from
  Oangband but the effect is somewhat different.
	Rod of Delving (Stone-to-Mud)
	Rod of Hidden Ways (Dimension Door)
	Rod of Unsung Heroes (Berserk Rage, Haste Self, Remove Fear)
	Rod of Illusions (Ghostliness, Invisibility, See Invisible)
- Added the "No confirm to destroy known worthless items." option from
  Zangband.
- The cheat_flav option was replaced with cheat_iden which makes the
  game behave as if all items have been *identified* when describing
  them.
- Monsters with quality drops may now also drop Rings of Lordly
  Protection and Rings of Extra Attacks.
- Vorpal weapons now do a flat 1/3 extra damage *after* factoring in
  weapon damage bonuses but the effect only kicks in half the time.
  This needs to be playtested.
- Vampiric weapons have had caps on their life draining removed but
  no longer drain monsters every blow. This needs to be playtested.
- The chaotic effects produced by Chaos brand weapons have been changed
  so that you will now get a player-centered, radius 2 ball of either
  chaos or disenchantment if the chaotic effect goes off.
- Replaced the Mage's 'Resist Poison' spell with 'Resist Electricity'.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug with the 'Resist Cold' spell.
- Fixed a bug with the separation of confusion and chaos and the 
  smart_cheat option.
- Fixed a bug with *ID-ing* certain artifacts.
- Fixed a bug with the "Immolation" spell in Purifications and Healing
  which was intended to be "Dispel Demons (x6)" but actually dispelled
  undead. Since dispelling demons doesn't fit with the theme of that
  book, the spell was moved to Wrath of God with altered minimum level
  and mana costs and reduced to x4.


Kangband 2.9.1r1
================

Codebase Updates
----------------
- Applied all the bug-fix patches to the 2.9.1 source available on
  Thangorodrim.
- Updated the makefiles using gcc to use the '-fno-strength-reduce'
  switch.

New / Changed Features
----------------------
- Added a new cheating option which identifies all flavored items by
  bypassing the p_ptr->aware checks. When in use, the game behaves as
  if all flavored items are known to the player. Switching off the
  option restores the original behaviour.
- Assigning the "LEVITATION" flag as an intrinsic racial ability via
  p_info.txt should now have the appropriate effect.
- You may no longer cross the "Chasm" terrain when levitating. This is
  in preparation for adding chasm streamers deep in the dungeon.
- Crossing lava is now allowed without fire resitance or levitation.
  However, you will take varying amounts of damage without these. Only
  fire immunity provides complete protection. Taken from Zangband.
- Crossing deep water when overburdened is now allowed. However, you
  will take damage from doing so unless you are levitating. Taken
  from Zangband.
- If the Illusion spell 'Shadow Form' expires while the player is
  moving through rock, the player will now take damage from being
  crushed. Adapted from Zangband.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fixed a bug with the timed levitation spell (which necessitated an
  increment to the version number).
- Fixed a bug that allowed cast spells to bypass the adult_ironman
  option and scrolls/rods of recall to bypass the time/space anchor.
- Fixed a bug with the adult_no_stores option that let you enter the
  special buildings when it was set.
- Fixed a problem with the 'Unknown Building' quest in the 'Haunting
  of Telamoor' plot which resulted in a 'nothing' object being
  created.
- Added various missing entries to font-ibm.prf, font-xxx.prf and
  font-new.prf (but have not checked for completeness). In most cases,
  this was done by assigning tiles used by Zangband for similar (in
  some sense) things. Note that 16x16 tiles are unavailable in some
  cases (denoted below by '*'). The non-trivial mappings are as
  follows:
